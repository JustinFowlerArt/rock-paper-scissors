## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styles

### What I learned

I learned a ton about working with gradients, extending Tailwind CSS gradients, and usings gradients and filters with SVGs. I also learned about making modals from scratch. This project relied heavily on dynamic styles and ternary operators for the bonus mode.

### Useful resources

- [Radial-Gradient Support](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/2599) - Code to extend Tailwind CSS with radial gradients
- [Gradients in SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Gradients) - This helped to learn the basics of SVG gradients, before extending to React SVG components
